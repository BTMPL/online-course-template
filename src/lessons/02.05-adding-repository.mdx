This is the first sublesson of first part.

Here is a preview of what you can do in your course content.

You _can use_ all kinds of **formatting** as you would with Markdown!

```jsx
const feature = `
  You can embed source code in a lot of languages!
`;
```

## And even better

```jsx live
const Greetings = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Hey {name}!</p>
      <p>
        You can even embed <em>interactive</em> and <em>editable</em> examples!
      </p>
    </>
  );
};

render(() => <Greetings name="dear reader" />);
```
